# Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization

## Resources

- [03_EDA_Data-visualization](https://github.com/edoardochiarotti/class_datascience/blob/main/2023/03_EDA-Visualization/Resources/03_EDA_Data-visualization.ipynb) covers:
	- What is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?
	- What are descriptive statistics?
	- How can data visualization help us?
	- Tips for better visualization
	- The data visualization landscape in python
	- EDA application to the [Global Preference Survey](https://www.briq-institute.org/global-preferences/home)
	- Data Visualization application to the [Green Domestic Product](https://e4s.center/resources/reports/green-domestic-product/) 

## Practice

- Once you have read the Resources notebook, train your EDA and data visualization skills with [03_EDA_Practice](https://github.com/edoardochiarotti/class_datascience/blob/main/2023/03_EDA-Visualization/Practice/03_EDA_Practice.ipynb):
	- You will work with real dataset: [Quality of Government Environmental Indicators Dataset](https://www.gu.se/en/quality-government/qog-data/data-downloads/environmental-indicators-dataset)
	- You will explore the relations between fishing ground biocapacity, climate change, fish comsumption, and environmental regulations
